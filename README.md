# Creation of Dashboard Client

This repository contains SQL queries used to create KPI's for a company overview dashboard. 
The project is built on an relational database 'Toys_and_models', with data such as customers
and employees of an fictitious international company. We have worked, first with MySQL, and integrated the SQL queries (see files on repo) on Google Data Studio in order to go out databases and visualisations (KPI) linked to each queries and visualisations for our dashboard.

The dashboard can be accessed through this link: https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/368c6108-8204-4302-872f-cba99412ec70/page/p_zrvc20m7nc

This is a team project at Wild Code School (Sept 2021)
